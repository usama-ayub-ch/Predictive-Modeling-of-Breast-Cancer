# Predictive Modeling of Breast Cancer: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the code and analysis for a comprehensive study on breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning techniques. 
We utilized "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set" containing various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies to predict the diagnosis (malignant or benign). 
Our analysis includes the implementation and comparison of multiple linear and non-linear machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and more, using R programming language. 
Through this project, we aim to provide insights into the performance of different models in diagnosing breast cancer, aiding in the selection of the most effective approach for future diagnostic applications.
